# Exercise 01: 
Write a program called circle.py that asks the user to enter the radius of a circle. Convert the input to data type float and assign the user input to a variable called radius. The program should then calculate and display the area and circumference of the circle using πr2 for the area and 2πr for the circumference.

*Hint: You can use 3.14159 as the value of pi(π).
