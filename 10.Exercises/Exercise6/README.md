#### Exercise 06:
It is possible to name the days 0 through 6 where day 0 is Sunday and day 6 is Saturday. If you go on a wonderful holiday leaving on day number 3 (a Wednesday) and you return home after 10 nights you would return home on a Saturday (day 6) Write a program which asks for the starting day number, and the length of your stay, and it will tell you the number of day of the week you will return on.
