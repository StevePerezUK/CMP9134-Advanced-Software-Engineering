#### Exercise 03: 
Write a computer program offer_loan.py to implement the following specification: A bank will offer a customer a loan if they are 21 or over, have an annual income of at least £21000 and has not received a loan in the past. The program takes in input from the user the customer’s age, their income and whether they have received a loan already. The program outputs the string “The loan can be offered: True” if the conditions are met, otherwise ”The loan can be offered: False”.

*Hints: bool() is the type casting function for converting to a boolean type.
