#### Note: 

1- You can attempt these Exercises in an OOP language, such as Python, Java, C/C++, etc. However, the naming of files used in the text of the exercises below presumes that python is used. You can change the file extension to the relevant language which you prefer to use.
2- Save your solution on your git repository.

#### Exercise 01: 
Write a program called circle.py that asks the user to enter the radius of a circle. Convert the input to data type float and assign the user input to a variable called radius. The program should then calculate and display the area and circumference of the circle using πr2 for the area and 2πr for the circumference.

*Hint: You can use 3.14159 as the value of pi(π).

#### Exercise 02: 
A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent of the total sales. Write a program called sales_prediction.py that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total sales and then displays the profit that will be made from that amount. The program should then display the projected total profits for each of the next following 10 years, assuming that the amount of total sales grows by 5 percent every year.
Make sure that all the printed profits are rounded to 2 decimal places, the underscore character is used to separate the hundreds from the thousands (and the thousands from the millions) groups of digits, and the amounts are 16 characters long with zeros to fill the empty spaces.
