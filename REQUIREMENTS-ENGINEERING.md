#### 1. Problem Definition: 
The Course Management System is an application that permits students to compare, tamper and present
studentâ€™s data in an important manner. The project develops student's information system for the Intranet
Automation of student information management system Software, if the institution does not have a
Course Information Management System, they face many problems specially about wasting time. It is
hard to find data and to get any comment from students or teachers, the system has been to ease good
Interaction/ communication facilities between the Students and administration. In doing so, the project
helps a lot in doing faster duties in Institutions, there are some new ideas like Bulletin board system,
Students comment, analysis skill student etc. We need some methods to complete that system using
detailed Unified Modelling Language (UML Diagram), Dataflow Diagrams and Entity Relationship
Diagrams (ER Diagrams). The web pages about students are created dynamically based on the student's
user ID, user password and links.
